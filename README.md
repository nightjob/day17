Create a new folder, npm init it, and set it up to be a Github repo with git init.

Install typescript localyl with npm install --save typescript, and install tsx globally with npm install --global tsx.
We use tsx to run typescript files (.ts)., jsut like we use node to run .js files.

ie: tsx index.ts

Exercises:

1. Create a function that accepts an array of strings, and prints out each one in a loop.

2. Create a function that takes 3 numbers, adds them together, and returns them as a number.

3. Create a function that takes a string as an argument, and returns a promise to return "hello" plus that string, as a string..

4. Create a function that accepts a single array where the elements can be strings OR numbers OR booleans. Loop over the array, and if the element is a string, print the string plus the text "is a string". If it's a number, print out the number plus "is a number". If it's a boolean, print out the boolean plus "is a boolean".

5. Objects can be types, declared like this:
   type MyObject = {
   user: string;
   }

const me: MyObject = {
user: "Horsey"
}

function printUser(obj: MyObject) {
console.log(obj.user);
}

Knowing this, create a type that represents a discord user that has the following properties:
name, which is a string
isAdmin, which is a boolean
isGMI, which is a boolean
and roles, which is an array of strings.

Then, create a type that represents a discord message that has the following properties:
user, which is type DiscordUser
text, which is a string
keks, which is a number.

6. Create functions that use your types:

- addKekToMessage which takes a discord message
- canDeleteServer which takes a discord user and checks if they are admin or not before returning a boolean
- editMessage which takes a discord message, a discorduser, and newText, and IF the user name is the same as the user on the discordmessage itself, allows them to edit the message.

7. Create a type that represents an NFT, with properties like imageURL, name, currentOwnerAddress, openSeaFloorPrice, and description.

8. Create a function that accepts an array of NFTs and returns the one with the lowest floor price. Not the floor price itself, but it returns an NFT. getCheapestNft
